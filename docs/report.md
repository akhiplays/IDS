# Report & Training Metrics

Run `backend/scripts/train_xgboost.py` after placing NSL-KDD files into `data/NSL-KDD/`. The script will print a classification report and save model artifacts to `model/`.

When you run training, paste the `classification_report` output here and include any notes about feature mapping, accuracy, precision/recall for major classes, and known limitations.


## Placeholder metrics

- Accuracy: (run training to populate)
- Per-class precision/recall: (run training to populate)
